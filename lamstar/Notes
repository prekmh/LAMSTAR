 - The update function in lamstar shouldn't update or create new nodes since there is
no output node information.

 - For image processing a decomposition in small areas of the image is more 
 appropriate. For a image of 200x150 we can use 20x15 areas, thus rendering
 100 input words 
 

 - For connections between the som modules themselves rather than maintaing a list of 
 all existing node connections, we can add for each training a list of the existing
 connections. The inter-module link score, which should be the most important, is 
 givven by the largest contiguous area similar with the testing pattern.
